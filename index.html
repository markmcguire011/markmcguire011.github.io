          Hi I'm <strong>Mark</strong>, a 2nd year <em>CS major</em> passionate
          about technology and making an impact. When I'm not working on my
          projects you'll probably find me out on a <strong>run</strong>,
          playing <strong>basketball</strong>, reading up on
          <strong>history</strong>, or researching my
          <strong>next project</strong>!
